# Awaze

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pallet/awaze.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pallet/awaze)

A clojure client library for AWS services, using the
[AWS Java SDK][awssdk], version 1.8.3.  See the
[SDK Release Notes][awssdk-release-notes].

The library is implemented using reflection to generate code, and therefore avoids
reflection at compile time or runtime when using the library.


Each AWS service is provided in a namespace under
`com.palletops.awaze.`, eg.  `com.palletops.awaze.ec2` for
EC2.

For each SDK function, two clojure functions are implemented.

The first is a direct wrapper that calls the sdk function directly.
This take an initial `credentials` argument, that expects a data map
with `:access-key`, `:secret-key` and optionally `:endpoint` keys.

```clj
(require '[com.palletops.awaze.ec2 :as ec2 :refer [ec2]])
(ec2/describe-instances
  {:access-key "AKIRIEDKE5ZBZG5VVCA"
   :secret-key "76dDdsKDJdsKDH+Uyuiy678Khjhkh8797vbnvnv"})
```

The second generated function, with a `-map` suffix, has the same
arguments and generates a data map that can be executed via a client
executor function.

```clj
(require '[com.palletops.awaze.ec2 :as ec2 :refer [ec2]])
(let [m (ec2/describe-instances-map
         {:access-key "AKIRIEDKE5ZBZG5VVCA"
          :secret-key "76dDdsKDJdsKDH+Uyuiy678Khjhkh8797vbnvnv"})]
  (ec2/ec2 m))
```

## Install

Add the following to your dependencies:

```clj
[com.palletops/awaze "0.1.2"]
```

## Usage

Each Amazon service client is in it's own namespace, in
`com.palletops.awaze.*`.

Each method of the client generates two clojure functions, one which executes
the client method directly, and one, with a `-map` suffix, that generates a map.
The map can be passed to a multimethod, with the same name as the service, which
actually runs the client method.

## Known issues

Setters with overloaded type arguments are not handled properly, and still cause
reflection.
